## 🎯 Core Concept

Private Green Travel Rewards is a privacy-preserving incentive system that rewards users for reducing carbon emissions through sustainable transportation. The system leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology to ensure that:

- 🔐 **Complete Privacy**: Your carbon savings data is encrypted and never revealed publicly
- 🎁 **Fair Rewards**: Automated tier-based reward calculation without exposing individual contributions
- 🌍 **Environmental Impact**: Encourages eco-friendly transportation choices (walking, cycling, public transit, carpooling)
- ⛓️ **Blockchain Transparency**: Verifiable rewards distribution while maintaining user anonymity

### How It Works

1. **Weekly Reward Periods**: Each period lasts 7 days
2. **Private Submission**: Users submit encrypted carbon savings data using FHE
3. **Tiered Rewards**:
   - 🥉 **Bronze** (1,000-4,999g CO2e): 10 tokens
   - 🥈 **Silver** (5,000-9,999g CO2e): 25 tokens
   - 🥇 **Gold** (10,000g+ CO2e): 50 tokens
4. **Anonymous Processing**: Rewards are calculated on encrypted data without revealing individual amounts
5. **Claim Anytime**: Users can claim their accumulated rewards whenever they want
